**Data & Tech Enthusiast | Business & Data Analyst | Product & AI Curious**

Hey there! I’m Sadhika Gorti, a Data Analyst with 3 years of experience in transforming raw data into actionable insights. My journey started with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, giving me a solid foundation in software development, algorithms, and problem-solving. While I initially dabbled in full-stack development, my passion for data-driven decision-making led me to focus on analytics, predictive modeling, and business intelligence.

I love unraveling complex data puzzles, designing insightful dashboards, and leveraging AI-powered analytics to drive smarter business decisions. Along the way, I’ve developed an appreciation for product ownership, agile methodologies, and strategic tech-driven problem-solving.
