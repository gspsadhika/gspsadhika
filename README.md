ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Sadhika Gorti, pursuing Master's in Business Analytics and Project Management at UConn.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data exploration and application of logical techniques to describe the data. I want my data to tell stories and paint pictures.

ğŸŒ± I am learning tools that will help me understand and translate data into meaningful insights. Data stories would communicate key insights clearly and inspire action in business.
