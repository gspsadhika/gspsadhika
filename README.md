**Data & Tech Enthusiast | Business & Data Analyst | Product & AI Curious**

I’m Sadhika Gorti — a data-driven technologist with a foundation in full-stack development and a passion for analytics and predictive modeling.

I started my career building responsive web apps using React, Node.js, HTML/CSS, and gradually transitioned into solving real-world problems through exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and data storytelling.
On this GitHub, you'll find:
Full-stack projects (React, Node.js) focused on real-time interactivity and clean UI/UX
EDA and predictive modeling notebooks using Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib
Work that blends product thinking, data insight, and clean technical execution
Always building, always exploring — whether it's on the front end or behind the data.
