**Sadhika Gorti**

Started as a Full Stack Developer | 📊 Now a Business Analyst | 🚀 Product Enthusiast

I'm passionate about solving problems where data meets design and strategy meets execution. With a background in Computer Science and a Master's in Business Analytics, I bring both technical depth and business insight to every project.

🛠️ I began my career building scalable web apps — now I analyze complex datasets, build predictive models, and create dashboards that drive decision-making.
🎯 My next goal: to own products end-to-end and build digital experiences that people love.
